# Railway Deployment Without SESSION_BASE64

Since the SESSION_BASE64 environment variable is too large (273KB) for Railway, here's an alternative approach:

## Option 1: Use Railway Volumes (Recommended)

1. Deploy the bot first without session
2. Use Railway CLI to upload session file:
   ```bash
   railway up sessions/my_telegram_session.session
   ```

## Option 2: Build Session into Docker Image

1. Create a deployment branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b railway-deploy
   ```

2. Temporarily add session to Docker image:
   ```dockerfile
   COPY sessions/my_telegram_session.session /app/sessions/
   ```

3. Deploy that branch to Railway

## Option 3: Use External Storage

Store the session file in:
- AWS S3
- Google Cloud Storage
- Any file hosting service

Then download it on startup.

## Why SESSION_BASE64 Fails

Railway has limits on environment variable sizes. A 273KB base64 string exceeds these limits, causing the deployment to fail silently.
